1. Create a new project of type Library named DotNetWithEndro.HW20210504

1.1 In the newly created project add a class called MathHelper

1.2. In the newly created class add one single method named Calculate. This method that performs one of the math operations addition,
     subtraction, multiplication or division on the first two arguments of this method. The third argument determins which math operation
     should be performed.

    



2. It is time to test our math helper class. In order to test our class add a new project of type console named DotNetWithEndro.HW20210504.TestApp. 

2.1 Add to the console app project a reference to the project DotNetWithEndro.HW20210504

2.2 In the Program class' method Main add the neccessary code to test your MathHelper class.



3. What is a better way test your code?
