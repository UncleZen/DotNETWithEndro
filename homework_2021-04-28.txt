1. Create a new project of type Library named DotNetWithEndro.HW20210428

1.1 In the newly created project add a class called MathHelper

1.2. In the newly created class add the following methods:

    Add
    This method takes in two arguments of type integer and returns the sum of the argumets

    Subtract
    This method takes in two arguments of type integer and returns the difference of the arguments

    Multiply
    This method takes in two arguments of type integer and returns the product of the arguments

    Devide
    This method takes in two arguments of type integer and returns the quotient of the arguments



2. It is time to test our math helper class. In order to test our class add a new project of type console named DotNetWithEndro.HW20210428.TestApp. 

2.1 Add to the console app project a reference to the project DotNetWithEndro.HW20210428

2.2 In the Program class' method Main add the neccessary code to test your MathHelper class.



3. What is a better way test your code.
