1. Create a new project of type Library named DotNetWithEndro.HW20210518

1.1 In the newly created project add a class called ListHelper

1.2. In the newly created class add the following methods:

    * A method that takes in an array and checks if the array is empty
    * A method that takes in an array of numbers and returns the total number of odd numbers
    * A method that takes in an array of numbers and returns the total number of even numbers
    * A method that takes in an array of string and checks if it contains an item specified by the second parameter



2. It is time to test our math helper class. In order to test our class add a new project of type console named DotNetWithEndro.HW20210518.TestApp. 

2.1 Add to the console app project a reference to the project DotNetWithEndro.HW20210518

2.2 In the Program class' method Main add the neccessary code to test your ListHelper class.



3. What is a better way test your code?
